  * Renamed TOX_MESSAGE_TYPE_MESSAGE to TOX_MESSAGE_TYPE_NORMAL.

  [ Dubslow ]
  * callback_file_request_chunk -> callback_file_chunk_request A couple of
    minor reasons, combined warrant a PR imo: a) fileChunkRequested is a
    better signal name than fileRequestChunkReceived, and I don't want to
    break consistency by reordering words for just this signal b) "request
    chunk" is parsed by English speakers as a verb-object combination,
    implying sending the request, not receiving, whereas "chunk requested" is
    parsed (more correctly) as an adjective-noun combo (in particular, request
    is    a noun not a verb), and thus reads far more like "hey heads up we
    just got a request"

  [ irungentoo ]
  * Fixed group audio issues when getting an old audio packet.
  * Fix build warning.
  * For file transfers UINT64_MAX is now used as the size for streaming
    transfers instead of 0.
  * Allow sending of file transfer requests with length 0 but don't allocate
    any file number for them in core.
  * Transfers with filelength == 0 now behave exactly like transfers of every
    other size (except streaming of course).
  * Renamed tox_file_send_control to tox_file_control.
