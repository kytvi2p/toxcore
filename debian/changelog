  [ irungentoo ]
  * tox_friend_get_public_key() now does nothing when public_key is NULL.
  * tox_file_send_chunk() must now send data the same length as requested in
    the requested chunk callback.

  * Make sure some defines in the public api are always correct.
  * Save function renamed to tox_get_savedata()
  * Renamed SEND_FAILED to SENDQ.
  * Kill all file transfers associated with the friend when friend goes offline.
  * Api changes.
  * When friend goes offline all his file transfers get removed.

  [ Dubslow ]

    friend_get_connection_status

  [ irungentoo ]
  * Merged normal message function and send action function into one messaging
    function.
  * Removed TOX_USER_STATUS_INVALID.
  * Renamed TOX_MESSAGE_TYPE_MESSAGE to TOX_MESSAGE_TYPE_NORMAL.

  [ Dubslow ]
  * callback_file_request_chunk -> callback_file_chunk_request A couple of
    minor reasons, combined warrant a PR imo: a) fileChunkRequested is a
    better signal name than fileRequestChunkReceived, and I don't want to
    break consistency by reordering words for just this signal b) "request
    chunk" is parsed by English speakers as a verb-object combination,
    implying sending the request, not receiving, whereas "chunk requested" is
    parsed (more correctly) as an adjective-noun combo (in particular, request
    is    a noun not a verb), and thus reads far more like "hey heads up we
    just got a request"

  [ irungentoo ]
  * Fixed group audio issues when getting an old audio packet.
  * Fix build warning.
  * For file transfers UINT64_MAX is now used as the size for streaming
    transfers instead of 0.
  * Allow sending of file transfer requests with length 0 but don't allocate
    any file number for them in core.
  * Transfers with filelength == 0 now behave exactly like transfers of every
    other size (except streaming of course).
  * Renamed tox_file_send_control to tox_file_control.
